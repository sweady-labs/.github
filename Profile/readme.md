## Who We Are

Welcome to **sweady labs** – a digital workshop where ideas take shape through pixels, circuits, and algorithms. We're not just building software; we're crafting experiences that blend cutting-edge AI with tangible, real-world solutions.

Think of us as mad scientists (the friendly kind) who believe that the best technology is:
- **Privacy-first** – Your data stays yours
- **Local & self-hosted** – Independence over dependency
- **Creative & practical** – Beauty meets function
- **Experimental** – We learn by building

---

## What We Build

### **AI-Powered Tools**
Making artificial intelligence work *for* you, not against you:
- **JobMatchAI** – Let LLMs craft your perfect application letter while you focus on being awesome
- **Paperless RAG Chatbot** – Chat with your documents like they're your smartest colleague (running locally on your Mac)

### **Home Automation & IoT**
Because your home deserves to be as smart as you are:
- **NetworkMonitorFritzBox** – Keep tabs on your network with Grafana & Prometheus
- **CircuitpyRGBMatrixS3** – Turn LED matrices into art with CircuitPython magic

---

## Our Philosophy

```python
def sweady_way():
    while True:
        experiment()
        learn()
        build()
        share()
        repeat()
```

We believe in:
- **Open experimentation** over perfection paralysis
- **Local-first solutions** over cloud lock-in
- **Practical innovation** over buzzword bingo
- **Learning by doing** over analysis paralysis

---

## Tech We Love

Our toolkit includes (but isn't limited to):
- Python (our Swiss Army knife)
- LLMs & AI (Ollama, local models)
- Monitoring & Viz (Grafana, Prometheus)
- IoT & Embedded (CircuitPython, ESP32)
- Automation (n8n, self-hosted workflows)

---

## Join the Experiment

Whether you're:
- A tinkerer who loves breaking things 
- A developer who ships code at 3 AM
- A privacy advocate who self-hosts everything
- Someone who just thinks our projects are neat

**You're welcome here!**

Check out our repositories, fork something interesting, or just star a project to say hi. We're always experimenting, always learning, and always excited to see what happens when curious minds collide.
