## 🌟 Who We Are

Welcome to **sweady labs** – a digital workshop where ideas take shape through pixels, circuits, and algorithms. We're not just building software; we're crafting experiences that blend cutting-edge AI with tangible, real-world solutions.

Think of us as mad scientists (the friendly kind) who believe that the best technology is:
- 🔐 **Privacy-first** – Your data stays yours
- 🏠 **Local & self-hosted** – Independence over dependency
- 🎨 **Creative & practical** – Beauty meets function
- 🔬 **Experimental** – We learn by building

## 🚀 What We Build

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Tools**
Making artificial intelligence work *for* you, not against you:
- **JobMatchAI** – Let LLMs craft your perfect application letter while you focus on being awesome
- **Paperless RAG Chatbot** – Chat with your documents like they're your smartest colleague (running locally on your Mac)

### 🏡 **Home Automation & IoT**
Because your home deserves to be as smart as you are:
- **NetworkMonitorFritzBox** – Keep tabs on your network with Grafana & Prometheus
- **CircuitpyRGBMatrixS3** – Turn LED matrices into art with CircuitPython magic

### 🎯 **Utility & Creativity**
The little things that make life better:
- **MaviCounter** – Count anything, beautifully

## 💡 Our Philosophy

```python
def sweady_way():
    while True:
        experiment()
        learn()
        build()
        share()
        repeat()
```

We believe in:
- **Open experimentation** over perfection paralysis
- **Local-first solutions** over cloud lock-in
- **Practical innovation** over buzzword bingo
- **Learning by doing** over analysis paralysis

---

## 🛠️ Tech We Love

Our toolkit includes (but isn't limited to):
- 🐍 Python (our Swiss Army knife)
- 🤖 LLMs & AI (Ollama, local models)
- 📊 Monitoring & Viz (Grafana, Prometheus)
- 🎛️ IoT & Embedded (CircuitPython, ESP32)
- 🔄 Automation (n8n, self-hosted workflows)

## 🌈 Join the Experiment

Whether you're:
- A tinkerer who loves breaking things (constructively)
- A developer who ships code at 3 AM
- A privacy advocate who self-hosts everything
- Someone who just thinks our projects are neat

**You're welcome here!**

Check out our repositories, fork something interesting, or just star a project to say hi. We're always experimenting, always learning, and always excited to see what happens when curious minds collide.
